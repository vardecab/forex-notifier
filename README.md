## How to use

### API key 

- Get API key (for free, takes 2 mins) from [here](https://currency.getgeoapi.com).
- Create `api` folder in the root of the project.
- Create `CCAP_API-key.txt` file in `api` folder.
- Add your API key to that file and save it.

### `run.py`

- Values are in PLN. In order to change that, change `base_currency` variable.
- Change `currency1` â€¦ `currency{#}` to desired currencies.

In both, use codes from [ISO 4217](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217).

- <s><i>(ðŸš§ temporary) If you don't want to use IFTTT (it's free) then you need to remove all references to IFTTT in the code.</i></s> IFTTT is now optional as of v2.1.

### `alertThresholds.py` 

- Modify this file with desired values to get alerts via IFTTT.

## Release History

- 3.8: Disabled crypto; disabled alerts; reverted emojis to symbols on Windows because Windows doesn't support [country flag emojis](https://emojipedia.org/flags/#:~:text=except%20Windows%2C%C2%A0which%C2%A0displays%20two%2Dletter%20country%20codes%20instead%20of%20emoji%20flag%20images).

- 3.4: Experimenting with auto updating repo.
- 3.3.1: Added +/- signs to DOT yield notifications.

- 3.1: Added continuous rate recording â€” appending values to the files rather than replacing them on each run.
